# Simple-Campus-network-using-CISCO-packet-tracer-
A campus network for two  departments and an admin office using Cisco Packet Tracer simulation software. The network has been designed to satisfy the demands of a contemporary campus setting with security, scalability, and efficiency in mind. It does this by combining a  variety of networking protocols and capabilities. 
Design a campus network of two or three departments and an admin office 
using CISCO packet tracer simulation software. The network topology must meet the 
following requirements: 
1. All switches and routers should be password protected.  
2. One of the departments would use the DHCP protocol to assign the IP addresses 
to all network hosts.  
3. One of the departments would contain a VLAN system to separate students and 
faculties networks.
4. A web server and a DNS server should be placed under the 
admin office.  
5. Any of your known dynamic routing protocols should be applied in the designed 
topology. 
6. Apply your desired ACL in routers to access the resources of the admin office. 
(For example, permit/deny any host/network to access the web server or any host 
in the admin office)
